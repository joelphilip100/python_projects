## Ideas to Implement

1. Multiple Dice Types - Allow the user to choose different types of dice (e.g., 4-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided) and roll them accordingly.
2. Lucky Number - Allow the user to set a "lucky number" and notify them when they roll that number.
3. Type "roll again" to roll the same number of dice as the previous roll 
4. A total roll counter, just to show the user the total number of rolls made during the current session.
5. Press "r" to random roll a particular number
6. Plotting the roll distribution
7. Sorting the distribution result and displaying it in ascending order
